# MariaDB Monitor

Up until MariaDB MaxScale 2.2.0, this monitor was called _MySQL Monitor_.

## Overview

MariaDB Monitor monitors a Master-Slave replication cluster. It probes the
state of the backends and assigns server roles such as master and slave, which
are used by the routers when deciding where to route a query. It can also modify
the replication cluster by performing failover, switchover and rejoin. Backend
server versions older than MariaDB/MySQL 5.5 are not supported. Failover and
other similar operations require MariaDB 10.0.2 or later.

## Master selection

Only one backend can be master at any given time. A master must be running
(successfully connected to by the monitor) and its *read_only*-setting must be
off. A master may not be replicating from another server in the monitored
cluster unless the master is part of a multimaster group. Master selection
prefers to select the server with the most slaves, possibly in multiple
replication layers. Only slaves reachable by a chain of running relays or
directly connected to the master count.  When multiple servers are tied for
master status, the server which appears earlier in the `servers`-setting of the
monitor is selected.

Servers in a cyclical replication topology (multimaster group) are interpreted
as having all the servers in the group as slaves. Even from a multimaster group
only one server is selected as the overall master.

After a master has been selected, the monitor prefers to stick with the choice
even if other potential masters with more slave servers are available. Only if
the current master is clearly unsuitable does the monitor try to select another
master. An existing master turns invalid if:

1. It is unwritable (*read_only* is on).
2. It has been down for more than *failcount* monitor passes and has no running
slaves. Running slaves behind a downed relay count.
3. It did not previously replicate from another server in the cluster but it
is now replicating.
4. It was previously part of a multimaster group but is no longer, or the
multimaster group is replicating from a server not in the group.

Cases 1 and 2 cover the situations in which the DBA, an external script or even
another MaxScale has modified the cluster such that the old master can no longer
act as master. Cases 3 and 4 are less severe. In these cases the topology has
changed significantly and the master should be re-selected, although the old
master may still be the best choice.

The master change described above is different from failover and switchover
described in section
[Failover, switchover and auto-rejoin](#failover,-switchover-and-auto-rejoin).
A master change only modifies the server roles inside MaxScale but does not
modify the cluster other than changing the targets of read and write queries.
Failover and switchover perform a master change on their own.

As a general rule, it's best to avoid situations where the cluster has multiple
standalone servers, separate master-slave pairs or separate multimaster groups.
Due to master invalidation rule 2, a standalone master can easily lose the
master status to another valid master if it goes down. The new master probably
does not have the same data as the previous one. Non-standalone masters are less
vulnerable, as a single running slave or multimaster group member will keep the
master valid even when down.

## Configuration

A minimal configuration for a  monitor requires a set of servers for monitoring
and a username and a password to connect to these servers.

```
[MyMonitor]
type=monitor
module=mariadbmon
servers=server1,server2,server3
user=myuser
passwd=mypwd
```

From MaxScale 2.2.1 onwards, the module name is `mariadbmon` instead of
`mysqlmon`. The old name can still be used.

The `user` requires the REPLICATION CLIENT privilege to successfully monitor the
state of the servers. SUPER privilege is required for cluster manipulation
features such as failover.

```
MariaDB [(none)]> grant replication client on *.* to 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Common Monitor Parameters

For a list of optional parameters that all monitors support, read the
[Monitor Common](Monitor-Common.md) document.

## MariaDB Monitor optional parameters

These are optional parameters specific to the MariaDB Monitor. Failover,
switchover and rejoin-specific parameters are listed in their own
[section](#cluster-manipulation-operations).

### `detect_replication_lag`

Deprecated and unused as of MaxScale 2.3. Can be defined but is ignored.

### `detect_stale_master`

Allow previous master to be available even in case of stopped or misconfigured
replication.

Starting from MaxScale 2.0.0 this feature is enabled by default. It is disabled
by default in MaxScale 1.4.3 and below.

This allows services that depend on master and slave roles to continue
functioning as long as the master server is available. This is a situation
which can happen if all slave servers are unreachable or the replication
breaks for some reason.

```
detect_stale_master=true
```

### `detect_stale_slave`

Treat running slaves servers without a master server as valid slave servers.

This feature is enabled by default.

If a slave server loses its master server, the replication is considered broken.
With this parameter, slaves that have lost their master but have been slaves of
a master server can retain their slave status even without a master. This means
that when a slave loses its master, it can still be used for reads.

If this feature is disabled, a server is considered a valid slave if and only if
it has a running master server monitored by this monitor.

```
detect_stale_slave=true
```

### `mysql51_replication`

Deprecated and unused as of MaxScale 2.3. Can be defined but is ignored.

### `multimaster`

Deprecated and unused as of MaxScale 2.3. Can be defined but is ignored.

### `ignore_external_masters`

Ignore any servers that are not monitored by this monitor but are a part of the
replication topology. This option was added in MaxScale 2.1.12 and is disabled
by default.

MaxScale detects if a master server replicates from an external server. When
this is detected, the server is assigned the `Slave` and `Slave of External
Server` labels and will be treated as a slave server. Most of the time this
topology is used when MaxScale is used for read scale-out without master
servers, a Galera cluster with read replicas being a prime example of this
setup. Sometimes this is not the desired behavior and the external master server
should be ignored. Most of the time this is due to multi-source replication.

When this option is enabled, all servers that have the `Master, Slave, Slave of
External Server, Running` labels will instead get the `Master, Running` labels.

### `detect_standalone_master`

Detect standalone master servers. This feature takes a boolean parameter and is
enabled by default.

This setting controls whether a standalone server can be a master. A standalone
server is a server from which no other server in the cluster is attempting to
replicate from. In most cases this should be left on.

### `failcount`

Number of consecutive monitor passes a master server must be down before it is
considered failed. At this point, automatic failover is performed if enabled
(`auto_failover=true`). If automatic failover is not on, the monitor will try to
search for another server to fultill the master role. See section
[Master selection](#master-selection)
for more details. Changing the master may break replication as queries could be
routed to a server without previous events. To prevent this, avoid having
multiple valid master servers in the cluster.

The default value is 5 failures.

### `allow_cluster_recovery`

Deprecated and unused as of MaxScale 2.3. Can be defined but is ignored.

### `enforce_read_only_slaves`

This feature is disabled by default. If set to ON, the monitor attempts to set
the server `read_only` flag to ON on any slave server with `read_only` OFF. The
flag is checked at every monitor iteration. The monitor user requires the
SUPER-privilege for this feature to work. While the `read_only`-flag is ON, only
users with the SUPER-privilege can write to the backend server. If temporary
write access is required, this feature should be disabled before attempting to
disable `read_only`. Otherwise the monitor would quickly re-enable it.

### `maintenance_on_low_disk_space`

This feature is enabled by default. If a running server that is not the master
or a relay master is out of disk space (as defined by the general monitor
setting `disk_space_threshold`) the server is set to maintenance mode. Such
servers are not used for router sessions and are ignored when performing a
failover or other cluster modification operation.

## Cluster manipulation operations

Starting with MaxScale 2.2.1, MariaDB Monitor supports replication cluster
modification. The operations implemented are:
- _failover_, which replaces a failer master with a slave
- _switchover_, which swaps a running master with a slave
- _rejoin_, which directs servers to replicate from the master
- _reset-replication_ (added in MaxScale 2.3.0), which deletes binary logs and
resets gtid:s

See [operation details](#operation-details) for more information on the
implementation of the commands.

The cluster operations require that the monitor user (`user`) has the following
privileges:

- SUPER, to modify slave connections and set globals such as *read\_only*
- REPLICATION CLIENT, to list slave connections
- RELOAD, to flush binary logs
- PROCESS, to check if the *event\_scheduler* process is running
- SHOW DATABASES and EVENTS, to list and modify server events

In addition, the monitor needs to know which username and password a
slave should use when starting replication. These are given in
`replication_user` and `replication_password`.

The user can define files with SQL statements which are executed on any server
being demoted or promoted by cluster manipulation commands. See the sections on
`promotion_sql_file` and `demotion_sql_file` for more information.

The monitor can manipulate scheduled server events when promoting or demoting a
server. See the section on `handle_server_events` for more information.

All cluster operations can be activated manually through MaxAdmin/MaxCtrl. See
section [Manual activation](#manual-activation) for more details.

### Operation details

**Failover** replaces a failed master with a running slave. It does the
following:

1. Select the most up-to-date slave of the old master to be the new master. The
selection criteria is as follows in descending priority:
 1. gtid_IO_pos (latest event in relay log)
 2. gtid_current_pos (most processed events)
 3. log_slave_updates is on
 4. disk space is not low
2. If the new master has unprocessed relay log items, cancel and try again
later.
3. Prepare the new master:
 1. Remove the slave connection the new master used to replicate from the old
master.
 2. Disable the *read\_only*-flag.
 3. Enable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).
 4. Run the commands in `promotion_sql_file`.
 5. Start replication from external master is one existed.
4. Redirect all other slaves to replicate from the new master:
 1. STOP SLAVE and RESET SLAVE
 2. CHANGE MASTER TO
 3. START SLAVE
5. Check that all slaves are replicating.

Failover may lose events if no slave managed to replicate the events before the
master went down.

**Switchover** swaps a running master with a running slave. It does the
following:

1. Prepare the old master for demotion:
 1. Stop any external replication.
 2. Enable the *read\_only*-flag to stop writes.
 3. Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).
 4. Run the commands in `demotion_sql_file`.
 5. Flush the binary log (FLUSH LOGS) so that all events are on disk.
2. Wait for the new master to catch up with the old master.
3. Promote new master and redirect slaves as in failover steps 3 and 4. Also
redirect the demoted old master.
4. Check that all slaves are replicating.

**Rejoin** joins a standalone server to the cluster or redirects a slave
replicating from a server other than the master. A standalone server is joined
by:
1. Run the commands in `demotion_sql_file`.
2. Enable the *read\_only*-flag.
3. Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).
4. Start replication: CHANGE MASTER TO and START SLAVE.

A server which is replicating from the wrong master is redirected simply with
STOP SLAVE, RESET SLAVE, CHANGE MASTER TO and START SLAVE commands.

**Reset-replication** (added in MaxScale 2.3.0) deletes binary logs and resets
gtid:s. This destructive command is meant for situations where the gtid:s in the
cluster are out of sync while the actual data is known to be in sync. The
operation  proceeds as follows:
1. Reset gtid:s and delete binary logs on all servers:
 1. Stop (STOP SLAVE) and delete (RESET SLAVE ALL) all slave connections.
 2. Enable the *read\_only*-flag.
 3. Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).
 3. Delete binary logs (RESET MASTER).
 4. Set the sequence number of *gtid\_slave\_pos* to zero. This also affects
 *gtid\_current\_pos*.
2. Prepare new master:
 1. Disable the *read\_only*-flag.
 2. Enable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).
3. Direct other servers to replicate from the new master as in the other
operations.

### Manual activation

Cluster operations can be activated manually through the REST API, MaxCtrl or
MaxAdmin. The commands are only performed when MaxScale is in active mode. All
commands require the monitor instance name as the first parameter. Failover
selects the new master server automatically and does not require additional
parameters. Rejoin requires the name of the joining server as second parameter.
Replication reset accepts the name of the new master server as second
parameter. If not given, the current master is selected.

Switchover takes one to three parameters. If only the monitor name is given,
switchover will autoselect both the slave to promote and the current master as
the server to be demoted. If two parameters are given, the second parameter is
interpreted as the slave to promote. If three parameters are given, the third
parameter is interpreted as the current master. The user-given current master is
compared to the master server currently deduced by the monitor and if the two
are unequal, an error is given.

Example commands are below:
```
call command mariadbmon failover MyMonitor
call command mariadbmon rejoin MyMonitor OldMasterServ
call command mariadbmon reset-replication MyMonitor
call command mariadbmon reset-replication MyMonitor NewMasterServ
call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor
call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor NewMasterServ
call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor NewMasterServ OldMasterServ
```

The commands follow the standard module command syntax. All require the monitor
configuration name (MyMonitor) as the first parameter. For switchover, the
last two parameters define the server to promote (NewMasterServ) and the server
to demote (OldMasterServ). For rejoin, the server to join (OldMasterServ) is
required. Replication reset requires the server to promote (NewMasterServ).

It is safe to perform manual operations even with automatic failover, switchover
or rejoin enabled since the automatic operations cannot happen simultaneously
with the manual one.

If a switchover or failover fails, automatic failover is disabled to prevent
master changes to a possibly malfunctioning cluster. Automatic failover can be
turned on manually via the REST API or MaxAdmin. Example commands are listed
below.

```
maxadmin alter monitor MariaDB-Monitor auto_failover=true
maxctrl alter monitor MariaDB-Monitor auto_failover true
```

When a cluster modification is iniated via the REST-API, the URL path is of the
form:
```
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/<operation>?<monitor-instance>&<server-param1>&<server-param2>
```
- `<operation>` is the name of the command: _failover_, _switchover_, _rejoin_
or _reset-replication_.
- `<monitor-instance>` is the monitor section name from the MaxScale
configuration file.
- `<server-param1>` and `<server-param2>` are server parameters as described
above for MaxAdmin. Only _switchover_ accepts both, _failover_ doesn't need any
and both _rejoin_ and _reset-replication_ accept one.

Given a MaxScale configuration file like
```
[Cluster1]
type=monitor
module=mariadbmon
servers=server1, server2, server3, server 4
...
```
with the assumption that `server2` is the current master, then the URL
path for making `server4` the new master would be:
```
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/switchover?Cluster1&server4&server2
```

Example REST-API paths for other commands are listed below.
```
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/failover?Cluster1
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/rejoin?Cluster1&server3
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/reset-replication?Cluster1&server3
```

### Automatic activation

Failover can activate automatically if `auto_failover` is on. The activation
begins when the master has been down at least `failcount` monitor iterations.
Before modifying the cluster, the monitor checks that all prerequisites for the
failover are fulfilled. If the cluster does not seem ready, an error is printed
and the cluster is rechecked during the next monitor iteration.

Switchover can also activate automatically with the
`switchover_on_low_disk_space`-setting. The operation begins if the master
server is low on disk space but otherwise the operating logic is quite similar
to automatic failover.

Rejoin stands for starting replication on a standalone server or redirecting a
slave replicating from the wrong master (any server that is not the cluster
master). The rejoined servers are directed to replicate from the current cluster
master server, forcing the replication topology to a 1-master-N-slaves
configuration.

A server is categorized as standalone if the server has no slave connections,
not even stopped ones. A server is replicating from the wrong master if the
slave IO thread is connected but the master server id seen by the slave does not
match the cluster master id. Alternatively, the IO thread may be stopped or
connecting but the master server host or port information differs from the
cluster master info. These criteria mean that a STOP SLAVE does not yet set a
slave as standalone.

With `auto_rejoin` active, the monitor will try to rejoin any servers matching
the above requirements. Rejoin does not obey `failcount` and will attempt to
rejoin any valid servers immediately. When activating rejoin manually, the
user-designated server must fulfill the same requirements.

### Limitations and requirements

Switchover and failover only understand simple topologies. They will not work if
the cluster has multiple masters, relay masters, or if the topology is circular.
The server cluster is assumed to be well-behaving with no significant
replication lag and all commands that modify the cluster complete in a few
seconds (faster than `backend_read_timeout` and `backend_write_timeout`).

The backends must all use GTID-based replication, and the domain id should not
change during a switchover or failover. Master and slaves must have
well-behaving GTIDs with no extra events on slave servers.

Switchover requires that the cluster is "frozen" for the duration of the
operation. This means that no data modifying statements such as INSERT or UPDATE
are executed and the GTID position of the master server is stable. When
switchover begins, the monitor sets the global *read_only* flag on the old
master backend to stop any updates. *read_only* does not affect users with the
SUPER-privilege so any such user can issue writes during a switchover. These
writes have a high chance of breaking replication, because the write may not be
replicated to all slaves before they switch to the new master. To prevent this,
any users who commonly do updates should not have the SUPER-privilege. For even
more security, the only SUPER-user session during a switchover should be the
MaxScale monitor user.

When mixing rejoin with failover/switchover, the backends should have
*log_slave_updates* on. The rejoining server is likely lagging behind the rest
of the cluster. If the current cluster master does not have binary logs from the
moment the rejoining server lost connection, the rejoining server cannot
continue replication. This is an issue if the master has changed and
the new master does not have *log_slave_updates* on.

### External master support

The monitor detects if a server in the cluster is replicating from an external
master (a server that is not monitored by the monitor). If the replicating
server is the cluster master server, then the cluster itself is considered to
have an external master.

If a failover/switchover happens, the new master server is set to replicate from
the cluster external master server. The usename and password for the replication
are defined in `replication_user` and `replication_password`. The address and
port used are the ones shown by `SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS` on the old cluster
master server. In the case of switchover, the old master also stops replicating
from the external server to preserve the topology.

After failover the new master is replicating from the external master. If the
failed old master comes back online, it is also replicating from the external
server. To normalize the situation, either have *auto_rejoin* on or manually
execute a rejoin. This will redirect the old master to the current cluster
master.

### Configuration parameters

#### `auto_failover`

Enable automated master failover. This parameter expects a boolean value and the
default value is false.

When automatic failover is enabled, traditional MariaDB Master-Slave clusters
will automatically elect a new master if the old master goes down and stays down
a number of iterations given in `failcount`. Failover will not take place when
MaxScale is configured as a passive instance. For details on how MaxScale
behaves in passive mode, see the documentation on `failover_timeout` below.

If an attempt at failover fails or multiple master servers are detected, an
error is logged and automatic failover is disabled. If this happens, the cluster
must be fixed manually and the failover needs to be re-enabled via the REST API
or MaxAdmin.

The monitor user must have the SUPER and RELOAD privileges for failover to work.

#### `auto_rejoin`

Enable automatic joining of server to the cluster. This parameter expects a
boolean value and the default value is false.

When enabled, the monitor will attempt to direct standalone servers and servers
replicating from a relay master to the main cluster master server, enforcing a
1-master-N-slaves configuration.

For example, consider the following event series.

1. Slave A goes down
2. Master goes down and a failover is performed, promoting Slave B
3. Slave A comes back

Slave A is still trying to replicate from the downed master, since it wasn't
online during failover. If `auto_rejoin` is on, Slave A will quickly be
redirected to Slave B, the current master.

#### `switchover_on_low_disk_space`

This feature is disabled by default. If set to `on`, when the disk space of a
server is exhausted, it will cause the server to be put in maintenance mode.
If the server is the current master, then a switchover will also be triggered.

In order for this parameter to have any effect, `disk_space_threshold` must
have been specified for the
[server](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#disk_space_threshold)
or the [monitor](./Monitor-Common.md#disk_space_threshold), and
[disk_space_check_interval](./Monitor-Common.md#disk_space_check_interval)
for the monitor.
```
switchover_on_low_disk_space=true
```
Note that once the server has been put in maintenance mode, the disk space
situation will no longer be monitored and the server will thus not automatically
be taken out of maintanance mode even if disk space again would become available.

#### `replication_user` and `replication_password`

The username and password of the replication user. These are given as the values
for `MASTER_USER` and `MASTER_PASSWORD` whenever a `CHANGE MASTER TO` command is
executed.

Both `replication_user` and `replication_password` parameters must be defined if
a custom replication user is used. If neither of the parameters is defined, the
`CHANGE MASTER TO` command will use the monitor credentials for the replication
user.

The credentials used for replication must have the `REPLICATION SLAVE`
privilege.

`replication_password` uses the same encryption scheme as other password
parameters. If password encryption is in use, `replication_password` must be
encrypted with the same key to avoid erroneous decryption.

#### `failover_timeout` and `switchover_timeout`

Time limit for the cluster failover and switchover in seconds. The default values
are 90 seconds.

If no successful failover/switchover takes place within the configured time
period, a message is logged and automatic failover is disabled. This prevents
further automatic modifications to the misbehaving cluster.

`failover_timeout` also controls how long a MaxScale instance that has
transitioned from passive to active will wait for a failover to take place after
an apparent loss of a master server. If no new master server is detected within
the configured time period, failover will be initiated again.

#### `verify_master_failure` and `master_failure_timeout`

Enable additional master failure verification for automatic failover.
`verify_master_failure` is a boolean value (default: true) which enables this
feature and `master_failure_timeout` defines the timeout in seconds (default:
10).

Failure verification is performed by checking whether the slave servers are
still connected to the master and receiving events. An event is either a change
in the *Gtid_IO_Pos*-field of the `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` output or a heartbeat
event. Effectively, if a slave has received an event within
`master_failure_timeout` seconds, the master is not considered down when
deciding whether to failover, even if MaxScale cannot connect to the master.
`master_failure_timeout` should be longer than the `Slave_heartbeat_period` of
the slave connection to be effective.

If every slave loses its connection to the master (*Slave_IO_Running* is not
"Yes"), master failure is considered verified regardless of timeout. This allows
faster failover when the master properly disconnects.

For automatic failover to activate, the `failcount` requirement must also be
met.

#### `servers_no_promotion`

This is a comma-separated list of server names that will not be chosen for
master promotion during a failover or autoselected for switchover. This does not
affect switchover if the user selects the server to promote. Using this setting
can disrupt new master selection for failover such that an nonoptimal server is
chosen. At worst, this will cause replication to break. Alternatively, failover
may fail if all valid promotion candidates are in the exclusion list.

```
servers_no_promotion=backup_dc_server1,backup_dc_server2
```

#### `promotion_sql_file` and `demotion_sql_file`

These optional settings are paths to text files with SQL statements in them.
During promotion or demotion, the contents are read line-by-line and executed on
the backend. Use these settings to execute custom statements on the servers to
complement the built-in operations.

Empty lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored. Any results returned by the
statements are ignored. All statements must succeed for the failover, switchover
or rejoin to continue. The monitor user may require additional privileges and
grants for the custom commands to succeed.

When promoting a slave to master during switchover or failover, the
`promotion_sql_file` is read and executed on the new master server after its
read-only flag is disabled. The commands are ran *before* starting replication
from an external master if any.

`demotion_sql_file` is ran on an old master during demotion to slave, before the
old master starts replicating from the new master. The file is also ran before
rejoining a standalone server to the cluster, as the standalone server is
typically a former master server. When redirecting a slave replicating from a
wrong master, the sql-file is not executed.

Since the queries in the files are ran during operations which modify
replication topology, care is required. If `promotion_sql_file` contains data
modification (DML) queries, the new master server may not be able to
successfully replicate from an external master. `demotion_sql_file` should never
contain DML queries, as these may not replicate to the slave servers before
slave threads are stopped, breaking replication.

```
promotion_sql_file=/home/root/scripts/promotion.sql
demotion_sql_file=/home/root/scripts/demotion.sql
```
#### `handle_server_events`

This setting is on by default. If enabled, the monitor will attempt to enable
and disable server events during a switchover, failover or rejoin. When a server
is being demoted, any events with "ENABLED" status are set to
"SLAVESIDE_DISABLED". The reverse applies to a server being promoted to master.
When a standalone server is rejoined to the cluster, its events are also
disabled since it is now a slave. The monitor does not check whether the same
events were disabled and enabled during a switchover or failover/rejoin. All
events with the expected status are altered.

The monitor does not enable or disable the event scheduler itself. For the
events to run on the new master server, the scheduler should be enabled by the
admin. Enabling it in the server configuration file is recommended.

Events running at high frequency may cause replication to break in a failover
scenario. If an old master which was failed over restarts, its event scheduler
will be on if set in the server configuration file. Its events will also
remember their "ENABLED"-status and run when scheduled. This may happen before
the monitor rejoins the server and disables the events. This should only be an
issue for events running more often than the monitor interval or events that run
immediately after the server has restarted.

### Troubleshooting

Before performing failover or switchover, the MariaDB Monitor first checks that
prerequisites are fulfilled, printing any found errors. This should catch and
explain most issues with failover or switchover not working. If the operations
are attempted and still fail, then most likely one of the commands the monitor
issued to a server failed or timed out. To find out exactly what the queries
sent to the servers are, start MaxScale with `--debug=enable-statement-logging`.
This setting prints all queries sent to the backends by monitors and
authenticators.

A typical reason for failure is that a command such as `STOP SLAVE` takes longer
than the `backend_read_timeout` of the monitor, causing the connection to break.
In this case , increasing the timeout settings of the monitor should help.
Another settings to look at are `query_retries` and `query_retry_timeout`. These
are general MaxScale settings described in the
[Configuration guide](#../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md). Setting
`query_retries` to 2 is a reasonable first try.

## Using the MariaDB Monitor With Binlogrouter

Since MaxScale 2.2 it's possible to detect a replication setup
which includes Binlog Server: the required action is to add the
binlog server to the list of servers only if _master_id_ identity is set.

For addition information read the
[Replication Proxy](../Tutorials/Replication-Proxy-Binlog-Router-Tutorial.md)
tutorial.

## Example 1 - Monitor script

Here is an example shell script which sends an email to an admin@my.org
when a server goes down.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#This script assumes that the local mail server is configured properly
#The second argument is the event type
event=${$2/.*=/}
server=${$3/.*=/}
message="A server has gone down at `date`."
echo $message|mail -s "The event was $event for server $server." admin@my.org

```

Here is a monitor configuration that only triggers the script when a master
or a slave server goes down.

```
[Database Monitor]
type=monitor
module=mariadbmon
servers=server1,server2
script=mail_to_admin.sh
events=master_down,slave_down
```
