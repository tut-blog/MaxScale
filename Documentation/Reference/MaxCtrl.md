# MaxCtrl

MaxCtrl is a command line administrative client for MaxScale which uses
the MaxScale REST API for communication. It is intended to be the
replacement software for the legacy MaxAdmin command line client.

By default, the MaxScale REST API listens on port 8989 on the local host. The
default credentials for the REST API are `admin:mariadb`. The users used by the
REST API are the same that are used by the MaxAdmin network interface. This
means that any users created for the MaxAdmin network interface should work with
the MaxScale REST API and MaxCtrl.

For more information about the MaxScale REST API, refer to the
[REST API documentation](../REST-API/API.md) and the
[Configuration Guide](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md).

monitor uses can be altered with the `link` and `unlink` commands.

### create monitor

`Usage: create monitor <name> <module> [params...]`

The list of servers given with the --servers option should not contain any
servers that are already monitored by another monitor. The last argument to this
command is a list of key=value parameters given as the monitor parameters.

### create service

filter parameters.

### create listener

`Usage: create listener <service> <name> <port>`

The new listener will be taken into use immediately.

### create user

`Usage: create user <name> <password>`

destroyed.

### destroy monitor

`Usage: destroy monitor <name>`

The monitor must be unlinked from all servers before it can be destroyed.

### destroy listener

`Usage: destroy listener <service> <name>`

Destroying a monitor causes it to be removed on the next restart. Destroying a
listener at runtime stops it from accepting new connections but it will still be
bound to the listening socket. This means that new listeners cannot be created
to replace destroyed listeners without restarting MaxScale.

### destroy service

`Usage: destroy service <name>`

The service must be unlinked from all servers and filters. All listeners for the
service must be destroyed before the service itself can be destroyed.

### destroy filter

`Usage: destroy filter <name>`

The filter must not be used by any service when it is destroyed.

### destroy user

`Usage: destroy user <name>`

The last remaining administrative user cannot be removed. Create a replacement
administrative user before attempting to remove the last administrative user.

## link

Commands:
  service <name> <server...>  Link servers to a service
  monitor <name> <server...>  Link servers to a monitor

```

### link service

`Usage: link service <name> <server...>`

This command links servers to a service, making them available for any
connections that use the service. Before a server is linked to a service, it
should be linked to a monitor so that the server state is up to date. Newly
linked server are only available to new connections, existing connections will
use the old list of servers.

### link monitor

`Usage: link monitor <name> <server...>`

Linking a server to a monitor will add it to the list of servers that are
monitored by that monitor. A server can be monitored by only one monitor at a
time.

## unlink

```
Usage: unlink <command>

Commands:
  service <name> <server...>  Unlink servers from a service
  monitor <name> <server...>  Unlink servers from a monitor

```

### unlink service

`Usage: unlink service <name> <server...>`

This command unlinks servers from a service, removing them from the list of
available servers for that service. New connections to the service will not use
the unlinked servers but existing connections can still use the servers.

### unlink monitor

`Usage: unlink monitor <name> <server...>`

This command unlinks servers from a monitor, removing them from the list of
monitored servers. The servers will be left in their current state when they are
unlinked from a monitor.

## start

```
Usage: start <command>

Commands:
  service <name>  Start a service
  monitor <name>  Start a monitor
  maxscale        Start MaxScale by starting all services

Stopping a service will prevent all the listeners for that service from
accepting new connections. Existing connections will still be handled normally
until they are closed.

### stop monitor

`Usage: stop monitor <name>`

Stopping a monitor will pause the monitoring of the servers. This can be used to
manually control server states with the `set server` command.

### stop maxscale

`Usage: stop maxscale`

This command will execute the `stop service` command for all services in
MaxScale.

## alter

```
Usage: alter <command>

Commands:
  server <server> <key> <value>           Alter server parameters
  monitor <monitor> <key> <value>         Alter monitor parameters

### alter monitor

`Usage: alter monitor <monitor> <key> <value>`

To display the monitor parameters, execute `show monitor <monitor>`

### alter service

`Usage: alter service <service> <key> <value>`

To display the service parameters, execute `show service <service>`. The
following list of parameters can be altered at runtime:

    "max_slave_connections",
    "max_slave_replication_lag"
]

### alter service-filters

`Usage: alter service-filters <service> [filters...]`

The order of the filters given as the second parameter will also be the order in
which queries pass through the filter chain. If no filters are given, all
existing filters are removed from the service.

For example, the command `maxctrl alter service filters my-service A B C` will
set the filter chain for the service `my-service` so that A gets the query first
after which it is passed to B and finally to C. This behavior is the same as if
the `filters=A|B|C` parameter was defined for the service.

### alter logging

`Usage: alter logging <key> <value>`

To display the logging parameters, execute `show logging`

### alter maxscale

`Usage: alter maxscale <key> <value>`

The list of host servers is controlled with the --hosts option. The target
server should not be in the host list. Value of <target> must be in HOST:PORT
format

### cluster sync

`Usage: cluster sync <target>`

This command will alter all MaxScale instances given in the --hosts option to
represent the <target> MaxScale. If the synchronization of a MaxScale instance
fails, it will be disabled by executing the `stop maxscale` command on that
instance. Synchronization can be attempted again if a previous attempt failed
due to a network failure or some other ephemeral error. Any other errors require
manual synchronization of the MaxScale configuration files and a restart of the
failed Maxscale.

## api

```
Usage: api <command>

Commands:
  get <resource> [path]  Get raw JSON

API options:
  --sum  Calculate sum of API result. Only works for arrays of numbers e.g. `api
