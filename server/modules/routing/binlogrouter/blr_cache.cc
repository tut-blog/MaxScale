/**
 * @file blr_cache.c - binlog router cache, manage the binlog cache
 *
 * The binlog router is designed to be used in replication environments to
 * increase the replication fanout of a master server. It provides a transparant
 * mechanism to read the binlog entries for multiple slaves while requiring
 * only a single connection to the actual master to support the slaves.
 *
 * The current prototype implement is designed to support MySQL 5.6 and has
 * a number of limitations. This prototype is merely a proof of concept and
 * should not be considered production ready.
