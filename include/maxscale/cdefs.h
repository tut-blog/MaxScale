 * This file has several purposes.
 *
 * - Its purpose is the same as that of x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/cdefs.h, that is,
 *   it defines things that are dependent upon the compilation environment.
 * - Since this *must* be included as the very first header by all other MaxScale
 *   headers, it allows you to redefine things globally, should that be necessary,
 *   for instance, when debugging something.
 * - Global constants applicable across the line can be defined here.
